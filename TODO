* PACK structs
* do endian conversion in usbredirparser where necessary
* check length against max packet size
* check caps for relevant callbacks in parser
* adjust iso packets per urb based on interval
* do some sanity checks in parser, like checking that additional
  data length == control_header->length, or 0 depending on direction.
