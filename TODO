* do endian conversion in usbredirparser where necessary
* check length against max packet size
* check caps for relevant callbacks in parser
* be smarter with iso buffering / make configurable (in qemu)
* cancel pending packets / active streams before reset?
* add a queue_buf call to parser, use it in host to avoid memcpy of
  "in" bulk transfers
* add a check for the makefile for libusb being atleast version 1.0.9
